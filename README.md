Linkage Clustering with L2, L1 , jacobian, correlation, cosine, jaccard, jaccard coefficient distance(without inbuilt libraries)

This repository implements linkage clustering algorithms using different distance metrics, including:

L2 (Euclidean) distance
L1 (Manhattan) distance
Jacobian distance
Correlation distance
Cosine distance
Jaccard distance
Jaccard coefficient distance

All implementations are from scratch, without relying on any inbuilt libraries. This allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms and provides a flexible framework for customizing and extending the clustering methods.
